# RocketMiles: HelloChange!
Author: **Kyle R. Almryde**

#### Preamble

Short and sweet little assignment for the good folks at RocketMiles. Written in Kotlin and build with Gradle.

### How do I get set up?
Grab your favorite IDE and import the project from source. This project uses ``Gradle`` for dependency 
management and for running unit tests, so make sure you have it installed. 

#### Running Application
Run the application in your IDE of choice via the main method found in 
``com.rocketmiles.krba.AppKT``. It is not recommended at this time to execute the ``gradle run`` task.
